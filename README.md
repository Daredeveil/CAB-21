# DATA SCIENCE course at Code Academy Berlin

## This folder will contain documentation

### Week-1 (CW 25)

1. Variable types
	1. Integer (x = 100)
	1. Float (x = 10.50)
	1. String (x = ‘Hello’ or “Hello”)

1. Single line comments in python starts with '#'

1. Document string comments ''' comment line 1, comment line 2 ....'''

1. type() command is used to see defined variable type e.g int or string or float

1. Numbers and arithmetic (PEMDAS Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction)

1. Built-in functions for numbers (min, max, abs ...)

1. Functions
	1. Build-in
	1. User defined
		1. def name(arguments):<br />
			statement 1<br />
			statement 2<br />
			print/return<br />

1. List
	1. Mutable (element can be changed)
	1. Ordered (unique index value)
	1. Heterogeneous (can contain different kind of elements in one list like string, integer, Boolean ...)
	1. Duplicates (multiple items with same value can be defined)
	1. Application : value of the item changed frequently

	1. Syntax
		i. List constructor ( my_list = list((1, ‘Tim’, 2)) )
		ii. Square brackets [ ] ( my_list = [1, ‘Tim’, 2] )

1. List Functions
	1. Number of items in a list: Length of a list ‘len(list_name)’

	1. Indexing: Individual element can be access via index (my_list[0])
	1. Sorting: Alphabetic sorting sorted(list_name)
	1. sum( ), max( )
 
1. List Methods
	1. list.append() : add item at the end
	1. list.pop() : remove last element
	1. list.index() : search specific element
1. Tuples
	1. Immutable (element cannot be modified)
	1. Syntax: round brackets ( )
		1. E.g. T = (1, 2, 3)

### Week-2 (CW 26)

What is Module <br/>
<br/>
A module allows you to logically organize your Python code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand. Therefore, module is similar to function that allow you to perform many actions without writing your own code. <br/>
<br/>
Library is a collection of modules. You can think of packages as the directories on a file system and modules as files within directories. For example, if you are working with data, numpy, scipy, pandas, etc. are the libraries you must know. <br/>
<br/>
For Numpy basics see [Numpy github link!](https://github.com/Daredeveil/CAB-21/blob/main/numpy_ex.ipynb) <br/>
<br/>
For Pandas basics and example see [Pandas github link!](https://github.com/Daredeveil/CAB-21/blob/main/Pandas_basic.ipynb) <br/>

#### Basic Statistics
<br/>
There are two major branches of statistics: <br/>
<br/>
1. Descriptive Statistics <br/>
Offers methods to summarise data by transforming raw observations into meaningful information that is easy to interpret and share. <br/>
<br/>

The parameters of descriptive statistics can be classifies into *4 categories* :
<br/>

	1. Frequency: A **frequency** is the number of times a value of the data occurs
1. Inferential Statistics <br/>
Offers methods to study experiments done on small samples of data and chalk out the inferences to the entire population (entire domain). <br/>
